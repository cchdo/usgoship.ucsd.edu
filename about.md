## RATIONALE FOR REPEAT HYDROGRAPHY SURVEYS IN SUPPORT OF CLIVAR AND CARBON CYCLE OBJECTIVES

The U.S. Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat Hydrography Program is part of
the international GO-SHIP program (http://www.go-ship.org), which
carries out a systematic and global re-occupation of select hydrographic
sections to quantify changes in storage and transport of heat, fresh
water, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and related parameters. By integrating the
scientific needs of the carbon and hydrography/tracer communities, major
synergies and cost savings are achieved. In addition to efficiency, the
coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of
individual programs. These advances contribute to the following
overlapping scientific objectives:

  * Data for Model Calibration and Validation
  * Carbon System Studies
  * Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies
  * Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies
  * Calibration of Autonomous Sensors

The scientific objectives are important both for research programs, such
as CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Prediction) and the carbon programs,
and for operational activities such as GOOS and GCOS (Global
Ocean/Carbon Observing Systems). The program addresses community needs
that one component of a global observing system for the physical
climate/CO2 system should include periodic observations of hydrographic
variables, CO2 system parameters, and tracers throughout the water
column.

The Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Program
(GO-SHIP; http://www.go-ship.org/) brings together scientists with
interests in physical oceanography, the carbon cycle, marine
biogeochemistry and ecosystems, and other users and collectors of
hydrographic data to develop a globally coordinated network of sustained
hydrographic sections as part of the global ocean/climate observing
system. GO-SHIP's development of a globally coordinated network of
sustained ship-based hydrographic sections has become an integral
component of the ocean observing system.

The objective of the repeat hydrography program is to maintain decadal
time-scale sampling of ocean transports and inventories of climatically
significant parameters, such as carbon system components, nutrients,
freshwater and heat over the entire water column. Earlier programs
[e.g., WOCE and JGOFS during the 1990s] provided a full depth baseline
data set that can be used, along with other data, for detection of
future changes, and showed where atmospheric constituents are entering
the oceans. The repeat hydrographic measurements reveal much about the
stability of internal pathways and changing patterns in ocean
properties. They continue to serve as a baseline to assess changes in
the ocean's biogeochemical cycle in response to natural and/or
anthropogenic activity. Long-term measurements are used to follow global
warming-induced changes in the ocean's transport of heat and freshwater,
which could affect the circulation by altering thermohaline overturning.
While autonomous sampling programs such as Argo and the basin-scale
volunteer observing ship programs can sample a portion of the
climate-relevant fields, that is, parameters important for heat and
freshwater in the upper part of the water column, they cannot at this
time sample the entire water column nor can they sample important
chemical tracer constituents. These semi-autonomous programs also cannot
provide calibrated data; sensors presently in use are subject to drift
and require occasional verification by in situ measurements. Broader
societal impacts of the program include: broad and near immediate
dissemination of data to enhance scientific and technological
understanding; societal benefits of collection of a high quality data
set, use of the data to assess climate change, and a resource for model
calibration of the climate system; promotion of training and learning
for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and new scientists.

### OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

The oversight committee for the US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat
Hydrography Program sees that the joint program of repeat hydrography,
ocean carbon, and tracer measurements is completed to fulfill the
scientific objectives of the program. The committee makes
recommendations on the sequence and coverage of the transects and
oversees any needed changes. They select a chief scientist, co-chief
scientist and 2-5 graduate students per cruise through community-wide
solicitations, and ensure that the core measurements are adequately and
consistently covered by the measurement teams for each cruise. They also
make recommendations regarding proposed add-on (Level 3) measurements;
for example, considering the requirements for extra ship time, berths,
and the seawater sample volume available for analyses. They ensure
smooth interactions with funding agencies and individual investigators,
and help see that adequate support is provided for the data management
structures. They serve as contact for coordinating with other national
and international efforts, and coordinate with CLIVAR and Carbon program
steering committees. They oversee pre-cruise planning, data submission,
and documentation, and work to ensure succession by entrainment of new
scientists into the program.

### DATA COLLECTED

The U.S. program measurements are presently divided into three levels in
order of priority. Level 1 core measurements are mandatory on all
cruises. The levels are also the suggested standard for international
collaborators, and should be measured at the highest practical spatial
resolution. The rationale for classifying a measurement as Level 1 is
based on data required to directly quantify change in ocean carbon
inventory, estimate anthropogenic CO2 empirically, characterize
large-scale water mass ventilation rates, constrain horizontal heat,
freshwater, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen transports and/or net
divergence, and provide an on-going basis for model evaluation. Level 2
measurements are highly desirable. They may be collected on coarser
spacing and will be closely coordinated with the core effort. Level 3
ancillary measurements are done according to opportunity and space
available. They should not significantly interfere with Level 1 or 2
efforts, and may be regional or specific to an individual cruise.

Within the U.S. a consortium of scientists typically leads each Level 1
and 2 observation type, working to integrate their measurement program
within the framework of the Carbon/CLIVAR national and international
program requirements.

Level  1 data:

  * Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
  * Total Alkalinity (TAlk)
  * pH
  * CTD pressure, temperature, salinity (calculated)
  * CTD oxygen (sensor)
  * Bottle salinity
  * Nutrients by standard auto analyzer (NO3/NO2, PO4, SiO3)
  * Dissolved oxygen
  * Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11, -12, -113) and SF6
  * Dissolved organic carbon
  * Dissolved organic nitrogen
  * Surface underway system (T, S, pCO2)
  * ADCP shipboard
  * ADCP lowered
  * Underway  navigation and bathymetry
  * Meteorological.

Level 2 data:

  * Tritium-3He
  * Discrete pCO2
  * 14C by AMS
  * CCl4
  * ∂13C of DIC
  * Fe/trace metals
  * CTD Transmissometer
  * Surface underway system (nutrients, O2, Chl, skin
    temperature).

Level 3 data (examples):

  * Chlorophyll
  * Primary production
  * HPLC pigments
  * Experimental continuous analyzers
  * ∂15N
  * NO3
  * 32Si
  * ∂18O of H2O
  * NH4
  * Low level nutrients
  * Total organic phosphorus
  * Upper ocean optical
  * isotopes of O2
  * N2, Ar, O2
  * Methyl halides
  * DMS


## CRUISE ORGANIZATION, PLANNING, AND DOCUMENTATION

Each cruise will be planned by the chief scientist and principal
investigators responsible for Level 1 and 2 measurements, taking into
consideration any special requests by other principal investigators for
Level 3 measurements. Priority for berths and ship laboratory space will
be given to the observation programs in Levels 1 and 2. Reasonable
requests for wire time, laboratory space and berths will be accommodated
for Level 3 observations. Any disputes will be negotiated with
assistance from the Oversight Committee. Investigators proposing add-on
(Level 3) measurements should note that the issue of support for any
required extra ship time, and the concomitant extra sea salaries for the
shipboard scientific party, is a sensitive one for which no firm program
or agency policy yet exists.

The sampling programs and investigator assignments are discussed by the
Oversight Committee well in advance of each cruise, to allow time to
cover any missing observation types. The committee works with funding
agencies to ensure that all Level 1 measurements are covered adequately
for each cruise, and that as many of the Level 2 measurements as
possible are also included.

The final sampling program, including exact cruise track, nominal
station locations, parameters to be sampled, anticipated precision and
accuracy of each measurement, and list of measurement groups or
personnel should be ready at least 3 months prior to the start of a
cruise.

### Documentation:

Full information regarding scientific operations at each station should
be logged, including deck operations, intended sample levels, types of
samples, any perceived problems with samples upon collection or initial
analysis, personnel involved in analysis, problems or unusual features
in the CTD profiles, etc. Sampling logs should be maintained, showing
every water sample drawn from each rosette bottle along with their
sequence or serial numbers, and with notations for mistrips, leaking
bottles, and other problems.

Documentation of sampling and analytical protocols should be submitted
with the data sets. Documentation with the initial data submission
should include a brief description of shipboard sampling procedures and
precision and accuracy of observations. Final documentation should also
include detailed descriptions of sample preparations, analytical
procedures, equipment calibrations, data reduction techniques,
computation algorithms, citations and anything else deemed necessary to
understand the suitability, accuracy and precision of the data values.

### Data Quality Standards

U.S. measurement standards for the ocean carbon and repeat hydrography
program adhere to or exceed those set by WOCE and JGOFS for CTD,
hydrographic properties and carbon system components.

The U.S. teams encourage comparison studies of international scope.

To provide the opportunity for comparison with historical data,
measurement techniques should be consistent with techniques used to
collect the existing data unless there is significant scientific
justification for change. When new techniques are adopted, methods for
relating the new data to existing data should be developed. This
requirement extends to regional comparisons as well.

As many measurements as possible should be made relative to a certified
reference material standard. Such standards now exist for salinity,
inorganic nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and
CFCs. Standards for other Level 1/2 measurements are urgently needed,
based on experience in WOCE and JGOFS, for example, improved
standardization of oxygen analysis procedures.

### Cruise Data Management

The principal investigators are responsible for data collection,
analysis, calibration, documentation, and submission to the data
assembly centers.

The data assembly centers are responsible for data merging, verification
and adjustment of data formats to community standards, online
dissemination and documentation, any further quality control (QC), and
archiving at NODC.

The program recognizes that at-sea data processing and documentation is
by far the most effective, easily justifying its up-front expense. The
oversight committee recommends that there should be at least one data
management specialist on board each cruise, who is responsible for
merging data, assembling documentation, and other matters. The
consortium for each measurement type work together to help the lead PI
for that measurement on a given cruise by providing tools, advice,
standards, etc., but the PI leading the measurement for that cruise is
responsible for the data processing and documentation. (Thus the PIs
doing each cruise must include data processing funds in their proposals
to do the sea work.) At a minimum, PI QC - applying quality flags as per
a standard protocol - should be done, with a second, post-cruise level
of QC carried out as needed for some parameters, e.g. carbon system.

The bottle S/O2/nutrient/CFC data must be quality controlled and merged
with preliminary processed CTD data shipboard quickly. These should be
made available to the carbon PIs within 5 weeks of the cruise in order
for the carbon data to be submitted within six months.

A single system of QC flag assignments and record keeping should be used
for all bottle parameters. The U.S. teams have agreed to use the WOCE
Hydrographic Program quality flag scheme.

The data management groups will be responsible for making the data
accessible to the community via worldwide web servers and online data
reports. The data management groups also see that the data are provided
to NODC.

## DATA POLICY OVERVIEW

In unilateral recognition of the international importance of these
globally distributed repeat hydrographic sections, and as an example to
other nations, the U.S. has chosen to adopt an "early release" data
policy which provides rapid access to all U.S. repeat hydrographic data
to all investigators. Thus the following data policy for hydrographic
observations has been adopted:

* Observations are made publicly available in preliminary form through the
  specified data assembly centers (the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data
  Center - CCHDO - http://cchdo.ucsd.edu for CTD and bottle data) as soon
  after collection as is practical ("early release"), with final
  calibrated data provided publicly when available. Collection is
  interpreted as the completion of the determination of the value of the
  particular parameter. Thus, for example, tritium/helium collection may
  not be complete for over a year after return to shore/laboratory.
  Timelines for each type of data are given below.
* All data collected as part of the repeat hydrography program will be
  submitted to a designated data management structure for quality control
  and dissemination for synthesis.
* Ultimately, all U.S. oceanographic data must be archived with the
  National Oceanographic Data Center, following timelines set by the
  funding agencies.

This data policy achieves at least two objectives:

* It allows data to be incorporated in a variety of analyses, including
  data assimilation, as soon as possible after collection, and carried out
  by numerous investigators, consonant with data policies for more rapidly
  sampled ocean observation programs, such as ARGO, VOS and satellite
  observations programs, as well as atmospheric observation programs.
* Reduction in the lengthy delays in data availability that occurred
  during previous work, such as WOCE, despite a stated maximum two-year
  proprietary period.

The "early release" policy for repeat hydrographic data recognizes that
these data are a publicly funded asset of significant scientific and
societal importance.

It is recognized that well-qualified, experienced and highly-motivated
investigators are necessary for success of the observation programs. The
U.S. program involves such investigators in acquisition of the data
sets, for example, by supporting their participation at sea. Data
analyses carried out through academic institutions are funded separately
through competitive proposals.

International GO-SHIP does not require that participating nations
subscribe to this policy of immediate data release. Most, if not all,
other nations' GO-SHIP cruises adhere to the WOCE requirements of a
two-year release from time of analysis. Some nations or individual
investigators are making at least some of their data available rapidly,
similar to the U.S. policy.

## APPLICATION OF THE DATA POLICY - TIMELINE

The "early release" data policy applies to all measurements in the core
program for repeat hydrography, including both Levels 1 and 2 (see core
measurements).

Daily during cruise:

* Reduced temperature, salinity, depth data sets via GTS as TESAC messages
* Meteorological observations

Within 5 weeks of the cruise, released to the relevant data management
structure:

* Preliminary CTD (pressure, temperature, salinity, oxygen if measured)
* A merged bottle data file including preliminary discrete salinity,
  oxygen, nutrients (and carbon system components)
* Preliminary CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, SF6
* Underway data, including continuous (1-minute) navigation, bathymetry,
* shipboard meteorological measurements, temperature, salinity, pCO2 (if 
  measured).
* Shipboard ADCP data

Within 6 months of the cruise, presuming the 5-week release of CTD and
discrete salinity data:

* Final salinity, oxygen, nutrients, CFC, CTD data
* Final underway data
* Final shipboard ADCP data
* Final carbon system parameters (Total CO2 and Total Alkalinity required;
  pH, pCO2 if measured)
* CDOM if measured
* Lowered ADCP (if measured)
* Any other Level 2 measurements

Within 6 months of shore-based analysis:

* Tritium/helium
* 14C and 13C
* DON if measured

Within 2 years of analysis (required NSF data release schedule):

* Any other (Level 3) observations. Those based on discrete bottle samples
  should be submitted to the hydrographic data management structure and
  merged with the other bottle data.
* Underway data should be submitted to the underway data management
  structure to be merged with the Level 1 and 2 underway data.
* Other discrete sampling programs that are likely to be carried out on
  many of the cruises, such as transmissometry and optics, should be
  submitted to the relevant data management groups (examples are a JGOFS
  SMP project for global transmissometry, and the NASA DAC for optics).

## DATA SUBMISSION

A subset of the temperature/salinity/depth and meteorological data
should be submitted in near real-time during the cruise, through the
GTS.

Data will be submitted following the cruise to the relevant data
management structure within the required timelines specified above.
Structures required for the repeat hydrography program (Level 1 and 2
data) should include centers for: CTD data, discrete bottle data,
underway data, ADCP data and meteorological data. Most Level 3 data sets
can be submitted to these centers.

## U.S. SUPPORT FOR OBSERVATIONS ON NON-U.S. CRUISES

Long repeat hydrographic sections are being carried out by other
nations. Some may not include all Level 1 and 2 observations. If U.S.
groups with the capability to provide these measurements participate on
non-U.S.-led repeat hydrography cruises, their data submission
requirements as outlined here are waived, in recognition that the
non-U.S.-led cruises will not be operating with the same submission
deadlines. This also recognizes the importance of collecting these
observations for the long-term record of ocean change.

Data collected by U.S. investigators on non-U.S. cruises should still be
submitted to the designated data management structures at the time of
public dissemination of the principal data sets or at two years,
whichever is earlier. If the non-U.S. data sets have an embargo on
publication that extends beyond 2 years, then the submitted U.S. data
should remain proprietary, that is, without dissemination, until the
non-U.S. release date.

The data management structures will make every effort to assemble the
complete data sets through contact with the non-U.S. principal
investigators.
