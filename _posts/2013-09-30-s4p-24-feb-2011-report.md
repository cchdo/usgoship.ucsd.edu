Our cruise for the NSF and NOAA-sponsored US Global Ocean Carbon and Repeat
Hydrography Program will cross the far-south Pacific sector of the Antarctic
region on the US Antarctic Program (USAP) icebreaking research ship Nathaniel
B. Palmer. We are scheduled for a 60-70 day voyage from the USAP McMurdo base
to Punta Arenas, Chile. This cruise is unique for the program in that it is
being carried out from a USAP ship operated by a commercial operator, Edison-
Chouest Offshore (ECO) (under charter to the US National Science Foundation),
with pre-cruise planning, shipping, logistics, and on-board science support
from a second company, Raytheon Polar Services Corporation (RPSC) (via
contract with the US National Science Foundation).

Our science team assembled in Christchurch, New Zealand, where we attended a
pre-ice-flight briefing and cold weather clothing issue, and on 14 February
flew to the ice sheet runway near Ross Island via a US Air Force C-17
transport. Although cancelled flights and "boomerangs" (flights turned back by
weather or equipment problems) are frequent, our flight went without incident.
The science team was excited to be in Antarctica and had two days to enjoy the
unique amenities, scenery, and recreational opportunities at the base,
including a guided tour to Robert F. Scott's 1902 "Discovery Hut" at Hut Point
on Ross Island.

We soon discovered that much of the S04P "do not freeze" cargo was for reasons
not yet explained sitting outdoors in sub-freezing conditions at McMurdo,
despite our use of the proper procedures, forms, and labels required for "do
not freeze" cargo items. In the end the chief scientific damage was to the
Argo float program, which was cancelled with all 17 floats shipped back to the
USA. By what appears to be a blind stroke of good fortune, the one "do not
freeze" cargo container which had been kept above freezing contained the
salinity and carbon seawater standards - with the loss of either the
expedition would have been cancelled. Some other cargo had been water damaged
at some point during transit, then was damaged by mold, then frozen, but the
direct losses to the science programs from that damage were minimal.

The science team boarded the ship midday on 17 February and soon set to
unloading scientific cargo from the 5 20-foot container vans and setting up
the CO2 lab van (a trace metal lab van was already at the ship from the
previous leg). All RPSC staff on the ship (staff from the previous cruise plus
staff from the S04P cruise) plus all ECO personnel were friendly and extremely
helpful. Lab set-ups went very well, again with RPSC and ECO personnel
efficiently providing assistance. Because the ship was refueled upon its
arrival, cargo loading and lab set-ups were delayed, making it necessary to
delay the ship's departure one day from the plan.

RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer departed McMurdo Base at noon local time on 20
February 2011 in good weather, into McMurdo region waters nearly free of sea
ice. The planned transit to the first station on the S04P line was estimated
to be approximately two days, barring stops. On the 21st the science team held
two test/training rosette casts with the large 36-place rosette. Only minor
problems were encountered, all fixed in short order. The evening of the 21st
the trace metal team carried out a trace metal cast of opportunity, making up
a station from the previous cruise lost to weather.

During the 22nd, as the ship neared the location of the first S04P station off
Cape Adare, winds rose well past 30 knots, then 40 knots. It was thus
necessary to wait until 1000 local time on 23 February to begin the S04P
transect stations.

After nearly two weeks of travel from the US, cruise preparation at McMurdo,
and transit to the northwestern Ross Sea, it was a joy to begin work. Weather
conditions have been good, and we have almost completed the portion of our
transect across the Ross Sea deep outflow with virtually no problems ... an
outstanding beginning.

Food on board is excellent, relationships between all on board friendly and
productive, the ship itself lovingly-maintained for productive research and
pleasant life on board. Some of our colleagues and hundreds of RPSC personnel
being flown out of McMurdo (as it switches from 1000-person summer staffing to
a 200-person winter complement) were caught in Christchurch by the latest
earthquake. We have heard that the people we worked with on board are safe,
though many were separated from their belongings, passports, and so forth, and
face many difficulties along with those endured by the residents of that
lovely small city. Our thoughts are truly with them.
