One of the major improvements to the 4th report of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, is the use of better predictive models. In the six years
since the publication of the third report, they’ve cleared up some uncertainty
by scoring the performance of their models to real observations.

We’ll take you aboard the Roger Revelle, a research vessel of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, to look at one of the first steps in climate
change prediction – collecting real-time data on which models are based.

In the first of a four-part series, we’ll look one cruise, I8S, as part of a
larger data collection program.

In February and March 2007, the R/V Roger Revelle spent six weeks sampling
water from Antarctica to the west coast of Australia, under the direction of
Captain David Murline and Chief Scientist James Swift. This transect is one of
about sixteen that are monitored every ten years in the Climate Variability –
CO2 Repeat Hydrography program, or CLIVAR for short.

CLIVAR was born out of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, a one-time
research project in the 1990’s that trolled the oceans and created a vertical
profile of water properties throughout the oceans, such as temperature,
density, and carbon and oxygen content. CLIVAR was developed to continue and
to improve on the measurements of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, to
create an ongoing record of the oceans on a decadal scale. It is the start of
a modern oceanographic record akin to the measurements taken by Charles
Keeling, who put a sensor on a tower in Mauna Loa, and first alerted us to the
rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere in the early ’60’s.

Measuring the oceans is more involved. To do it right, you have to take a boat
out, drop an array of bottles and sensors overboard, and haul them back up,
processing water samples on-site. And then you repeat this, in our case, over
80 times. Each of these steps takes time, technology, and manpower, as well as
a lot of money and planning. CLIVAR is an international program, and in the
United States, it’s funded by the National Science Foundation and the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).

In the planning stages of CLIVAR, scientists at a convention took a beach-ball
of the Earth, and drew in lines which they felt represented the world’s
oceans. These lines have since been debated and pared down, but there is a
randomness to their names. Chief Scientist Jim Swift, who was present at the
meeting, has this to say:

> Why, for instance, is this called 8South and 9N? There’s some – we’ll call
it goofiness to the WOCE line numbers. I9 comes over here, and I9 south over
her, I9N comes up here…it’s just scientists, you know, doing their thing.

All of these transects have a common purpose, but each individual cruise
requires months of planning by the Chief Scientist, who tailors the trip to a
particular region, and also accommodates add-on programs from other
scientists. A day of shiptime on the Roger Revelle costs a minimum of $29,000.
So whenever possible, the scientists collaborate to save on operational costs
like shiptime, fuel, and labor.

What really sets I8S apart from other CLIVAR cruises is location. Because the
transect starts in Antarctica, the trip departs from New Zealand and requires
two weeks of travel time to its first sampling station. Chief Scientist Jim
Swift discusses the planning:

> So I got some historical ice information; well, there’s a lot of ice there
in December, so December’s too early to start the cruise. But if I look at
January, we’re getting a big reduction in the ice, and by February, that’s the
ice minimum. And oh, by March, it’s starting to grow in again. So the sea ice
minimum in this region was in approximately overall February, so I told the
ship scheduling people that the ideal for us was to reach this point at the
ice minimum in early February.

Our cruise track, if transcribed on the opposite side of the world, would
start with a two week steam across the North Atlantic, from the coast of
France to Hudson Bay, and then a sampling route that runs south, down through
the Great Lakes to Alabama, and then out to Bermuda.

In early February, we left port in Dunedin, New Zealand on a southwestern
course, our ship laden with food and lab equipment for the next six weeks. We
plunged through the Roaring ‘40’s which are followed by the Roaring ‘50’s,
latitude zones that are located in the only place in the world where there is
infinite fetch. Fetch refers to the distance a wave can travel before it
breaks; the further a wave has traveled, the more energy it has. The waves in
the Roaring 40’s and 50’s are caught in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and
can theoretically travel in a circle around Antarctica forever. The waves
don’t break, but they produce colossal swells. Luckily, Captain Murline’s
steady course keeps seasickness to a minimum, and cribbage tournaments keep us
occupied through the worst of it. We are well-rewarded when we cross over the
Circumpolar Current.

Josh Green reads from the blog of Joe Ferris, second-mate:

> When you get so far south the wind dies down and the clouds part and you
have beautiful days from the high pressure system that always sits over the
continent. Also great long sunsets and sunrises. Getting here we haven’t seen
the sun for two weeks, and lots of fog. [But] now [that] we are here and its
amazing, we…turn around and starting working our way back north.

Along with the sun, the proximity to Antarctica brought icebergs in all shapes
and sizes, from those you could net with a fishing net, to entire islands that
dwarfed our ship. It was a treat for the passengers, but a strain on the crew.

Second mate Joe Ferris, whose responsibilities include navigating the night
watch, writes:

> Today rates as one of the most intense 4 hour watches of my 8 year career at
Scripps Institution. While driving a north-westerly line…we again ran into the
ice edge. From the satellite maps we knew to expect it somewhere in the
vicinity…but the ice edge today was blown and dispersed seaward from southerly
winds… we approached the ice edge trying to see how close we could get and
looking for a safe spot for a station. There was none, small bergs were
everywhere…[and] we spent a good three hours maneuvering around icebergs at
close quarters to get out. Pretty spectacular stuff, except I really didn't
have much time to enjoy it since I was the one on the helm.

Still, manning the controls on the night watch has its perks:

> Last night I was treated to a once in a lifetime display of Aurora
Australis, otherwise known as the Southern Lights. We had a big storm all
afternoon, but by midnight the sky cleared and off on the horizon a blank of
clouds started glowing green. Suddenly the Aurora Australis developed into a
wide band arcing and dancing across the entire sky. The bands were shifting
between purple, pink, and green, and it all seemed so…close that it [felt
like] we were in it…

>

> I tried calling the labs but everyone was asleep, so I woke the chief
scientist up and when he saw the show he called everyone else. Ten minutes
later I had about 20 scientists on the bridge, they didnt see the best of
show, but they got to view some bands develop and dance around for a hour
before it completely died out.

machines and robots of data collection, on-board I8S.
